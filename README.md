## Senior Pedestrians in NYC: 
## A Diff-in-Diff Approach to Evaluating Safe Streets for Seniors


### Motivation

1. People are flocking to cities and the US population is growing older
2. A key component of urban life: Walkability
3. But NYC streets are dangerous for senior pedestrians
  - Fatality rates are 4x higher for seniors
  - And 16% higher in NYC than the rest of the nation (Nicaj et al.)
4. NYC’s response → Senior Pedestrian Focus Areas (SPFAs)
